**Styling is entirely optional for this project.** You will have to use state and props for this!

Keeping track of planets is hard if you're a galactic pilot. Your goal is to create an app for Star Wars pilots using React.

## Requirements

* You need to use React, and create an `App` component as well as at least one other component (I'd recommend a `Planet`).
* You need to fetch planet data from the `Star Wars API` using `fetch()`. Here's a short sample of how to use `fetch`. You can get planet data by making a `GET` request to `http://swapi.co/api/planets`.
* You need to have the pilot input their name and display it on the page somewhere.

### Hints

* Think of what the app's state is going to include, and what parts of that state need to be shared with other components.
* Think about when you want to make your API requests. It may involve the component lifecycle...
